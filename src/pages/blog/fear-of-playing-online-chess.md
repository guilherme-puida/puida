# Fear of playing online chess

I learned how to play chess when I was maybe 6 or 7 years old.
Since then, I've been playing semi-regularly with long pauses in between, but
ever only over the board.

With the pandemic and the global chess popularity boom, I started playing online
too. At first, I was not really worried about rating and just played for fun.
But when my rating started to (slowly) grow, I started to become more and more
anxious about losing games.

I dreaded seeing my rating go down, and queuing up for a match became difficult.
Deep down I knew that it didn't really matter, but I still had anxiety about
blundering a piece or missing an obvious forced mate.

Games with a longer time control were my biggest nightmare, since I couldn't blame
my mistakes on time trouble. So I started playing only blitz and eventually bullet.
This made my tactic spotting skills plummet, and I just premoved openings and played
random moves most of the time.

After a few hundred games, even bullet became too overwhelming, so I just quit
playing.

Spending a few months away from online chess made me realize that I missed the game.
I still watched youtube videos and recaps from major championships, and I just
wanted to get back to playing. However, the fear was still there, and when I opened
[lichess](https://lichess.org) my anxiety went through the roof.

So I started a new account.

## New begginings

With a fresh new account, I could focus on playing and not on my rating.
I activated [zen mode](https://lichess.org/page/zen) and queued up for a game.
I intentionally lost the first few games to get my rating down to a level where
I could play comfortably.

By playing only rapid games, I could focus on spotting good moves and not blundering
in an idiotic manner. I still lost quite a few matches, but I was starting to get
comfortable while queuing up.

Slowly, my rating started to go up.

## The rise

I was winning more often than losing, and spotting my oponent's mistakes was getting
easier. I was far from crushing all of my games, but a few well-played lines and
forced checkmate sequences reinstated my confidence.

I'm not a great player by any means, but seeing 90%+ accuracy games made me feel like
a prodigy _(even though I'm way too old to be considered one)_.

But the most important part was that **I was having fun again**.

## Current state

I'm playing more and more, and I'm not too worried of losing anymore.
I'm not 100% sure that my fear is gone, but it appears to be more
mellow than before.

I'll just focus on playing and studying when I get the chance, and maybe
I'll break the 1500 barrier sometime soon.
